                <h3>How to Play Game?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Initially, some blocks will be randomly filled. Players need to take sufficient time to move the blocks one by one until all the blocks are filled.</li>
                    <li>Once all the blocks are filled, an alert box will display the message "You Finished The Game Successfully!"</li>
                    <li>To complete the game, players need to move each block logically based on the positions of the filled blocks.</li>
                    <li>Press "New Game" to restart the game from the initial state.</li>
                </ul>
            </dialog>
        </section>
    </main>

    <div class="addendum">
        <h3>Addendum:</h3>
        <p>1. The primary goal of the game is to completely fill all the default boxes with colors. Upon successful completion, an alert box will display the message "You Win!"</p>
        <p>2. A 5x5 board is created in a matrix format where some boxes are randomly filled with color at the start.</p>
        <p>3. Players need to logically move the boxes to turn off all the boxes with colors.</p>
        <p>4. Clicking the "New Game" button restarts the game to its initial state, allowing the user to start over. The "Learn Game Rules" button provides a dialog box with game instructions and a close button.</p>
        <p>5. A 5x5 grid is created using CSS grid layout. The aesthetics and usability depend on balancing the size of the cells and the spacing between them.</p>
        <p>6. The random initial state of the colors ensures replayability. At least one box is filled initially to engage the player.</p>
        <p>7. Due to the random starting state, balancing difficulty was challenging. To maintain a fair challenge, different setups were tested with at least one box initially filled.</p>
        <p>8. Implementing clear visual feedback for toggling colors was difficult. Players' actions are immediately reflected by CSS classes controlling the color states and manipulating DOM elements.</p>
        <p>9. Careful planning of the interface design and event handling for each cell was crucial to creating an intuitive and responsive interface.<br> Smooth cell interactions and a responsive layout contributed to an engaging, user-friendly game experience.</p>
        <p>10. The game identifies a win when all boxes lights are turned off. Upon successful completion, the game provides immediate gratification and feedback. </p>
